# IoT Based Smart Home System

## Overview
This Project aims to create a Smart Home System that turns a fan and an LED ON/OFF depending upon the ambient light and temperature and also has a mode where you can clap to turn on the light.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Digital Output Sound Sensor Module  (LM393 Sound Sensor Used)
- LDR Module (LM393 LDR Module Used)
- DHT11 for Temperature and Humidity Sensing
- 2-pin FAN
- LED
- 3 * 1.2k Ohms Resistors
- Jumper Cables
- Breadboard

## External Libraries Used
- DHTStable.h by Rob Tillaart 
- LiquidCrystal_I2C.h by Frank de Brabander
